# Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation

## 🎯 Overview
The Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation project aims to analyze customer data, segment customers into distinct groups, and generate personalized product recommendations. This project leverages clustering techniques and statistical analysis to drive data-driven business insights.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis of customer data to identify trends and patterns.
- 🧮 **Clustering Techniques**: Implementation of algorithms such as:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - DBSCAN
- 🛠️ **Anomaly Detection**: Using Isolation Forest for identifying outliers in the data.
- 📈 **Silhouette Analysis**: Evaluate the quality of clustering and determine the optimal number of clusters.
- 🤝 **Personalized Recommendations**: Generate product recommendations based on customer segments.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- Python: Core programming language
- pandas & numpy: Data manipulation and numerical operations
- matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization
- scikit-learn: Clustering and preprocessing techniques
- IsolationForest: Anomaly detection

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**:
   - Load and clean the data.
   - Scale and encode features for clustering.
2. **Clustering**:
   - Apply clustering algorithms to segment customers.
   - Evaluate clustering performance using silhouette analysis.
3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Use Isolation Forest to identify and filter anomalies.
4. **Product Recommendations**:
   - Develop strategies to recommend products for specific customer segments based on identified patterns.

## 📂 Structure
- **Cust Segm and Prod Recom.ipynb**: Main notebook with project implementation.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python libraries for running the project.

## 🌟 Example
Segment customers based on purchasing behavior, and recommend products. For instance:
- A high-value customer segment might be recommended premium products.
- A budget-conscious segment might receive offers for discounts and bundles.
